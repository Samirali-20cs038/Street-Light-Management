# Automatic Street Light Control
In this project we have built an IOTbased automatic street light control using esp32, which is the main controller board which is connected to the driver board which prevents the access current to pass, a light dimmer is also used.
Using the LDR sensor, not only will we control the brightness of light , but we will also monitor the system using iot on the basis of weather or surroundings, wherever the wifi connectivity is not available , we will use the gsm800A
module.
So this project will be helpful to the people of nagarpalika and manual power on/off will not be required. It will also save the power and turn off the light when it's not in use.
